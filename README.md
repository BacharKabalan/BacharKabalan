### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Bachar Kabalan and I am a crowd dynamics expert and consultant. You can call me Bash or even Sponge Bash. This is because I love learning and absorbing new concepts and ideas. 

* **What I do now ->** Using my knowledge in people movement and crowd dynamics, I provide expert advice on crowd planning for some of the biggest and most iconic venues in the world. I have worked on major sports events, UNESCO world heritage sites, busy train stations, museums and many more. 🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏻🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏻🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏻🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏻🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏻🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏻

* **What I am dreaming of doing 💭🌟🤩 ->** I have been learning concepts and techniques in data science for the past 6 years. This has been a roller coaster journey as I tried to balance work, personal relationships and personal goals, fears and passions. I dream of transitioning into the data science world. Working with exceptionally smart people and doing very cool stuff with data engineering and data science.

My journey would have been impossible if it weren't for the incredible people that have shared their knowledge and made it available to everyone 🙏🙏🙏. This is my humble attempt to emulate their behaviour and help other travelers on these roads. I would specifically like to mention the following people: 

- **Andre Ng**, with whom it all started. 🧙
- **Lorenzo Greco**: a friend who already did what I am aspiring to do and always encourages to me to keep going, providing me with books, tips, networking opportunities and moral support. 🤗❤️
- **PyData meetups** where I found out about Founders and Coders. Also one of the presentations were around building cheap robots and programming them with AI models that can identify the best conditions to grow stems cells. EXTREMLEY INTERESTING!! 👨‍🔬👨‍🔬
-  **Amazon meetup** where scientists from stability.ai and hugging face were presenting. You could feel the level of intelligence and innovation in the room! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
-  **London Analytics meetup** where i find out about Otta recruitment website. Once of the attendees also advised me to focus on Data Engineering rather than DeepLearning as it offers an 'easier' access to the sector. ❤️
-  **UCL meetup** where I learned about the models Google is developing to forecast weather and model fluid dynamics. Again, intelligence was off the roof!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Good luck to everyone on a similar journey and please do reach out if you need any futher information, support or just to have a chat and share experiences.
