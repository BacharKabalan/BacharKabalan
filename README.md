### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Bachar (Bash) Kabalan and I am a crowd dynamics expert and consultant. 

Using my knowledge in people movement and crowd dynamics, I provide expert advice on crowd planning for some of the biggest and most iconic venues in the world. I have worked on major sports events, UNESCO world heritage sites, busy train stations, museums and many more. 

I have been learning concepts and techniques in data science, machine learning, finance and algorithmic trading for the past 6 years. This has been a roller coaster journey as I tried to balance work, personal relationships and personal goals and passions. 

As I also love creating mind maps and diagrams, I will use this visualization technique to convey what I have been learning. 

In my repos you will find: 
- Theory and knowledge: all the theoretical concepts that I have learned on data science, machine learning, finance and algorithm trading. 

- Techniques: a collection of projects that allow me to practice the concepts i learned. 

My journey would have been impossible if it weren't for the incredible people that have shared their knowledge and made it available to everyone. This is my humble attempt to emulate their behaviour and help other travelers on these roads. I would specifically like to mention the following people: 

- Andre Ng

- TradeOptionsWithMe: https://www.youtube.com/c/TradeOptionsWithMe
- QuantConnect: https://www.quantconnect.com/tutorials/tutorial-series/introduction-to-financial-python

Good luck and please do reach out if you need any futher information, support or just to have a chat and share experiences.
